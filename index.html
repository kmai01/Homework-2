             Hello, I'm currently enroll in a web development course in Houston,TX. This is our first home work assignment.
             I'm going to tell you a little bit about my background before this couse.
            </p>
            Most of my career is in the oil field industry with Halliburton. I spent 12 years as a Measuring While Drilling engineer (MWD) in the oil field. They nick named some of us MWD
            as "movie watching dude" because some would watch movie while monitoring the drilling. In reality , it is a physically and mentally challenging job. You have deal with the enviroment because most of time you will be working outside. Also you have to be prepare for incase something goes wrong. For example, one time when we had to abandon ship because of a well blow out.

            <p>After 12 years in the oil field , I got the opportunity to work in the office as a software tester. There I tested a software that we used in the oil field with our drilling tool.
            I also get to test new and enhanced features that add to the software. We tested the software according to Agile methology where you would break down the new features to smaller user stories. With smaller user stories, the task is easier to manage. 
            </p>
               In my spare time, I like to upgrade my PC or build a new one and benchmark it. My last project was adding water cooling with clear water tubing. Also I play Diablo 3 from time to time.
